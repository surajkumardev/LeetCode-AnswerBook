->To Solve this question we need to make a approach that every single day is a best selling day 
->And make the strategy a/c to that only
-> We will run the loop from 1 only as we cannot sell without buying the stock. 

//-> Here is the solution for the code 
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int maxprofit=0; int bestbuy=prices[0];
        for(int i =1;i<prices.size();i++){
            if(prices[i]>bestbuy){
                maxprofit=max(maxprofit,prices[i]-bestbuy);
            }
            bestbuy=min(bestbuy,prices[i]);
        }
        return maxprofit;
    }
};

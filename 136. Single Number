Approach->
You can Solve These questions by using plenty of approaches like the Nested loop, Mapping, etc
But This is the question that clears your understanding of to how to understand the question 
To solve this we are going to use the bitwise xor operator 
In the Xor operation if we have the same value then we get the output as zero 
This is the concept that we are going to use here
Every number has been repeated twice except the one 
To find that number we are going to use the xor operation 
Thank you 

//Code->
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
     
        int ans=0;
        for(int i: nums){
            ans=ans^i;
        }
        return ans;
        
    }
};
